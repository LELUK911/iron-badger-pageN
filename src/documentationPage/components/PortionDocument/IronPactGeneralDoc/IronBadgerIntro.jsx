                I am proud to introduce this new liquidity framework developed within the Iron Badger Brotherhood.
                Our mission is to make liquidity ecosystems more programmable, optimizing participation dynamics.
                With ambition, we have created what we consider a new foundational element for the DeFi ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Imagine an ecosystem for Pact agreements where any user – from the most renowned DeFi platform seeking
                liquidity without selling off its tokens to the everyday participant looking for new opportunities –
                can access a transparent, programmable, and reliable environment.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The ecosystem currently includes the following elements:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">

                <li>Iron Forge</li>
                <li>Iron Rise Auction</li>
                <li>Iron Fall Auction</li>
            </ul>
