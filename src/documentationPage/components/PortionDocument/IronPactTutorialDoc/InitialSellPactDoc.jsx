                After the Pacts are sold, the debtor will be able to withdraw the proceeds
                collected from the sale. If, for any reason, the debtor wishes to cancel the sale,
                this is possible. However, it should be pactd that the first sale and transfer
                can only be directed to <strong>Iron Forge</strong>. This restriction is lifted after the initial sale.
