            <p>Last updated: April 2025</p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Iron Badger Brotherhood ecosystem, which includes the protocols Iron Pact, Iron Forge, Iron Rise, Iron Fall, and any other future services.
                Access to and interaction with the protocols occur exclusively through public and autonomous smart contracts on compatible blockchains.
                There is no direct management or custody of usersâ€™ funds by any centralized entity.
                By accessing or interacting with any of the protocols, you fully agree to these Terms of Use.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Protocol Features</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Iron Pact Protocol:</strong> Create peer-to-peer collateralized agreements using programmable Semi-NFTs.</li>
                <li><strong>Iron Forge Protocol:</strong> Manage and sell newly created Pacts to allow debtors to raise decentralized liquidity.</li>

            <p>All protocols are fully automated through smart contracts, with no intermediaries or external fund management.</p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. No Custody or Fund Management</h3>
            <p>
                The ecosystem does not manage, does not hold, does not invest, and does not administer funds on behalf of users.
                All interactions occur directly on the blockchain via public contracts.
                Users retain full control over their assets at all times, freely interacting with the protocols.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">4. No Financial Offer or Investment Proposal</h3>
            <p>
                The ecosystem does not offer regulated financial products, does not promote investments, and does not guarantee any economic returns.
                Any profit or loss resulting from the use of the protocols is solely the responsibility of the user.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Risks</h3>
            <p>Using the protocols involves risks, including (but not limited to):</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Fluctuations in the value of collateral tokens.</li>

                <li>Liquidity risks or difficulties in selling assets quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users are strongly encouraged to carefully evaluate the risks before interacting with the protocols.</p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Acceptance of Terms via Wallet Connection</h3>
            <p>By connecting their wallet and interacting with any of the protocols, users:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Confirm that they have read, understood, and accepted these Terms of Use.</li>
                <li>Accept the application of these Terms without the need for a separate physical or digital signature.</li>
                <li>Declare that they are fully responsible for their actions on the platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Amendments to the Terms</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms may be updated or modified. Changes will become effective upon publication, and it is the users' responsibility to review any updates.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">8. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
                Until the potential establishment of a formal DAO or legal entity, the ecosystem operates on a purely decentralized basis, without association to any specific national jurisdiction.
                Any future updates will extend applicable legal references if necessary.
